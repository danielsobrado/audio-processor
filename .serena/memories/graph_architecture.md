# Graph Architecture and Patterns

## Graph Database Architecture

### Core Pattern
**Service Layer Architecture** with optional graph processing that provides graceful degradation when disabled.

### Integration Flow
1. **Transcription Pipeline** → processes audio to text
2. **Graph Processor** → extracts relationships from transcription results
3. **Graph Service** → stores structured data in Neo4j
4. **Graph API** → exposes graph queries via REST endpoints

### Configuration-Driven Design
- **100% YAML-driven configuration** with no hardcoded values
- **Feature flag control** via `graph.enabled` setting
- **Environment-specific settings** (dev, prod, local, uat)

### Graph Data Models

#### Node Types
- **Speaker**: Individual speakers in conversations
- **Topic**: Conversation topics based on keywords
- **Entity**: Extracted entities (emails, phones, dates, URLs)
- **Conversation**: High-level conversation containers
- **TranscriptSegment**: Individual speaker segments

#### Relationship Types
- **SPEAKS_TO**: Speaker interactions
- **DISCUSSES**: Topic relationships
- **MENTIONS**: Entity references
- **PART_OF**: Hierarchy relationships
- **FOLLOWS**: Temporal sequences

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple operations in single transactions
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource management
- **Indexes**: Optimized query performance
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking database operations

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues without graph processing when disabled
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and monitoring

### Graph Query Patterns
- **Speaker Networks**: Analyze interaction patterns and speaking time
- **Topic Flows**: Track conversation transitions and keyword evolution
- **Entity Extraction**: Identify and link structured data
- **Temporal Analysis**: Time-based relationship queries

### Service Integration
- **Dependency Injection**: Graph services injected where needed
- **Optional Dependencies**: Services work without graph functionality
- **Health Checks**: Monitor graph database connectivity
- **Startup/Shutdown**: Proper resource lifecycle management
