# Example configuration for enabling translation
# Add these environment variables to enable translation

# Core Translation Settings
TRANSLATION_ENABLED=true
TRANSLATION_PROVIDER=huggingface
TRANSLATION_MODEL_NAME=Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es  # English to Spanish model
TRANSLATION_DEVICE=cpu  # or 'cuda' if GPU available

# Alternative models for different language pairs:
# English to French: Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr
# English to German: Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de
# English to Italian: Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-it
# Spanish to English: Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-es-en
# French to English: Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-fr-en

# For multiple language support, you can use multilingual models:
# TRANSLATION_MODEL_NAME=facebook/mbart-large-50-many-to-many-mmt

# Performance Notes:
# - Use 'cuda' device if you have a GPU for faster translation
# - CPU translation is slower but works on any machine
# - Translation models are loaded once per worker startup
# - Each model handles specific language pairs
